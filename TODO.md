# Home Depot Self-Service RMA POC - Project Plan

## Overview
This project implements a self-service merchandise return system for Home Depot, excluding large and hazardous items.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot with REST APIs
- **Frontend**: React with modern UI/UX
- **Database**: SQLite for development
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipeline
- **Code Quality**: SonarCube integration
- **Deployment**: Google Cloud Run

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation
- [x] Create project structure with backend and frontend
- [ ] Design and create SQLite database schema
- [ ] Set up Spring Boot application with basic configuration
- [ ] Set up React application with modern tooling

### Phase 2: Core Backend Development
- [ ] Implement customer authentication and authorization
- [ ] Build order validation and eligibility checking logic
- [ ] Create return management APIs (create, update, track)
- [ ] Implement shipping label generation for warehouse returns
- [ ] Generate QR codes for in-store returns
- [ ] Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- [ ] Build React components for return workflow
- [ ] Implement customer login and order lookup
- [ ] Create return reason selection and method choice UI
- [ ] Add return tracking and status display
- [ ] Implement responsive design with modern UI/UX

### Phase 4: Integration & Quality
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- [ ] Integrate SonarCube for code quality analysis
- [ ] Configure Google Cloud Run deployment
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Unit and integration testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing of complete return workflow
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] Production deployment and monitoring

## Return Workflow Implementation
The system follows this flow:
1. Customer logs into Home Depot account
2. Selects 'Return/Replace Item'
3. Enters Order Number or scans receipt
4. System validates purchase and checks eligibility
5. Customer selects return reason and method
6. System generates shipping label (warehouse) or QR code (store)
7. Customer completes return and tracks status
8. Home Depot processes return and notifies customer

## Business Rules
- Large and hazardous items are excluded from self-service returns
- Returns must be within Home Depot's return policy timeframe
- Valid purchase verification required
- Multiple return methods supported (warehouse shipping, store drop-off)
- Real-time status tracking and notifications

## Success Criteria
- Complete end-to-end return workflow functionality
- Modern, intuitive user interface
- Robust error handling and validation
- Automated testing and deployment pipeline
- Production-ready deployment on Google Cloud Run
